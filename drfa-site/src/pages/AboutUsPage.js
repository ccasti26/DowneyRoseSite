            <p>The Downey Rose Float Association is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization comprised completely of volunteers. Each year the Association is responsible for organizing, building and decorating a float to represent the City of Downey in the annual Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade held every New Year's Day.</p>

            <p>The Downey Rose Float Association has a long history with the Tournament of Roses. In 1913 we submitted our first entry into the parade and again in 1920 where we took 4th Place. In 1952 a talented group of citizens founded the Downey Rose Float Association (DRFA) and incorporated in 1954.</p>
            <p>Since The Downey Rose Float Association was established in 1952 The Downey Rose Float Association has won 20 trophies the most recent being The Founders&apos; Trophy for "On The Wings of Hope" during the 2020 Tournament of Roses Parade.</p>

            <p>Downey's entry has the distinction of being one of only <em>six</em>  floats which come under the parade classification of self-built. This classification means that the Downey Rose Float is entirely self-funded, constructed, and decorated. Our mission is to continue to raise funds for the successful continuation and representation of the City of Downey while bringing community members together and fostering civic pride.</p>
            <p>We invite everyone in the community to attend our monthly meetings and to contact us to find one of the many ways you can support the organization through membership, fund raisers, or volunteering.</p>
