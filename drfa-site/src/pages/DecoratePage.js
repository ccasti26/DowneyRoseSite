            <h2>Volunteer to decorate the float!</h2>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in volunteering to decorate the Downey Rose Float!</p>
            <p>It is truly a  rewarding experience to watch a float you helped decorate proudly turn the corner on Colorado Boulevard on New Year's Day. If this will be your first time decorating a Rose Parade float, you will get a glimpse of the long hours and dedication put into each float, as well as the wonderful memories of working with the community to create a work of art. Newcomers and old-timers alike are welcome to join the decorating effort. Before you do so, please review the rules and guidelines to ensure an enjoyable and safe experience is had by all.</p>
            <p>Volunteers are needed to add flowers, seeds and other materials that will turn the float into a beautiful work of art.</p>
            <p>We begin decorating in December during our "Deco Week" which starts on December 26th until the float leaves for the parade the night before the Parade, from 10am to 10pm.</p>
